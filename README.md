# 🚦 Task-05: Traffic Accident Analysis – Prodigy InfoTech Internship

📌 Objective
This project is part of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship. The goal of this task is to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. It aims to visualize accident hotspots and explore the major contributing factors to improve public safety and awareness.

📂 Task Description
> Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

🗂️ Dataset Used
Dataset Source: [Prodigy InfoTech](https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech)US Accidents – Kaggle (by Sobhan Moosavi)
Type: Real-time US traffic accident dataset
Features: City, State, Time, Weather Conditions, Road Conditions, Severity, etc.
Target: Accident severity and contributing factors

🧠 Analysis Workflow
Data Preprocessing:
Data cleaning and null value handling
Feature engineering for time (hour, day, etc.)
Filtering and grouping for analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Identified peak accident hours and days
Analyzed impact of weather and road conditions
Checked severity distribution across states and cities
Geospatial Visualization:
Created interactive maps using Folium
Plotted accident hotspots and density by location
Visualization:
Bar plots and pie charts
Heatmaps and scatter plots
Time-based trend analysis

📈 Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Plotly & Folium
Jupyter Notebook

✅ Results & Conclusion
The analysis revealed clear trends in traffic accidents:
Accidents are more frequent during peak commuting hours
Bad weather (rain, fog, snow) and poor visibility increase accident severity
Urban areas and highways have higher accident density
Weekdays have more incidents compared to weekends.
